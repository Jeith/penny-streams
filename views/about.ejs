			<p>This website does not make any money and will never be used for commercial purposes in the future. None of our esimates on how much Spotify pays artists is guaranteed as some artists and labels have deals with Spotify and Spotify uses a <a href="https://www.fim-musicians.org/wp-content/uploads/prorata-vs-user-centric-models-study-2018.pdf" target="_blank">pro rata payout distribution model</a> to calculate artist's total payout. On average, Spotify pays the copyright holder(s) around $0.00318 per stream on a song, but this can vary from $0.003 - $0.006. We also don't include featured songs to the total earnings.</p>
